## About The Project

The idea to build Gardener was spawned through watching a real-world scenario of a home gardener building a schedule in googlesheets to manage his garden filled with over 50 different plants. There are many websites filled with information on what people should grow and when they should sow their seeds, but no one-stop-shop to help gardeners to maintain their plants and provide proactive reminders on tasks that need to be undertaken throughout the year.

### GA Project Requirements
The application must:

- Craft thoughtful user stories together, as a team
- Write your code DRY and build your APIs RESTful.
- Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
- Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS
- Deploy your application online so it's publically accessible

## Roadmap
### Initial Planning & Workflow

1. Brainstormed ideas for MVP of product, keeping track of out-of-scope ideas on trello. 
2. Completed a draft workflow
3. Sketched wireframe and created a trello board to finalise stories - see our planning artefacts - 1. [ER diagram](Planning Artefacts/ER Diagram and DB details.png), 2. [Wireframes](Planning Artefacts/Wireframes.jpg), 3. [User flows](Planning Artefacts/Userflows.jpg), 4. [Initial Designs](Planning Artefacts/Initial Designs.png))
4. Planning and setup- ER diagram, database design, codebase and git repo.
5. Team members identified a story that they wanted to take on. 
6. Quickly decided on colour palette, branding and layout of to do and myplants page. 
7. Systematically worked on features, with frequent commits.


## Future Planning & Workflow

- Ability for user to update password on user/edits page. 
- Finalise frontend development for remaining pages
- Validate data fields on pages eg. signup/signin, add product, edit product, add comments. 
- Add validation via Active Record & error messages
- Check database for access on UPDATE/CREATE routes eg. Non-Current user can edit products is manually inputed.
- Create modal to confirm deleting a product.
- Add more data
